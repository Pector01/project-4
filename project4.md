# PECTOR DOCUMENTATION PROJECT 4
- After I learnt how to deploy LAMP, LEMP and MERN Web stacks, in this project, I got myself familiar with MEAN stack and deploy it to Ubuntu server. First I updated and upgraded my server `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` respectively and the essence of updating and upgrading in every project is to get the lastest version. For certification purpose, I ran  `sudo apt -y install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates` alongside    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -` on the ubuntu server. Nodejs was installed `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6` and `echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list`
MongoDB was installed `sudo apt install -y`

to install the body parser, I ran `sudo apt install -y npm` to install the node package manager and `sudo npm install body-parser`
`sudo npm install express mongoose`
- I created another directory with this command `mkdir apps && cd apps` and created a file inside the apps directory with the command `vi routes.js` pasted and saved the codes inside the documentation inside the file. In the apps directory, I create another foler with this command `mkdir models && cd models` and created a file inside the models directory with the code `vi book.js` With `cd ../..`  returned to the Boos directory and created another directory with this command `mkdir public && cd public` inside which I created anew file with `vi script.js` and pasted the codes inside the documentation and saved it accordingly. Inside the public directory, I created a new file with `vi index.html` and pasted some codes inside. In the Books directory, I ran `node server.js` I later changed my Inbound security rule TCP to port 3300 as directed and here is my output
